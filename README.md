<h1>*this repo is for javascript famous problems you could get asked in a technical interview:</h1>
<ul>
<li>classic algorithms</li>
<li>array manipulation</li>
<li>string manipulation</li>
<li>Object & Data Structure Challenges</li>
<li>Function Implementation</li>
<li>DOM & Practical Challenges (you will need to use HTML livserver for this) </li> 
</ul>
<hr/>
<h5>notes: just do "<script src="neededFile.js"></script>" <br/> after each challenge you will also get what's the methods Time / Space Complexity</h5>
<h5>Time Complexity: measures how long your code takes to run as the input size grows. It's about speed. <br/>
 O(1) - constant: same time regardless of input size (accessing an array element) <br/>
 O(n) - linear: time grows with input size (looping through an array) <br/>
 O(nÂ²) - quadratic: nested loops, gets slow quickly
</h5>
<h5>Space Complexity: measures how much memory your code uses as input grows. It's about RAM. <br/>
 Creating variables? That's space. <br/>
 Copying arrays? That's more space. <br/>
 Recursion? Each call uses stack space. <br/>
